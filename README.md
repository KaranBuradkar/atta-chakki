## **Configuration Overview (Internal)**

This project is configured for a real-world, single-business deployment.
Environment-specific values such as database credentials, JWT secrets,
and OAuth configurations are managed internally and are not documented
for public setup.

The repository focuses on demonstrating backend architecture,
API design, and business workflows rather than deployment instructions.
